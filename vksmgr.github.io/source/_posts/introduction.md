# Introduction

This blog is about leaning algorithms using rust. in this series we are going to learn

- Setting environment.
- rust programming language.
- And algorithms. 

After these we are going to start solving problems from well known book's
like
- Algotrithm Books.
    * CLRS
    * Sahani
- Craking coding interview.

these series include everything which you will need to start solving algorithm problems using rust.
